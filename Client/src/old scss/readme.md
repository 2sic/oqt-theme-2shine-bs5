# SCSS Variables

## How it works

1. The `theme.scss` file is the entry point. Webpack takes this and generates the  `wwwroot/Themes/ToSic.Oqt.Themes.ToShineBs5/theme.min.css`
1. The `_variables.scss` is the file that prepares all the variables. This is where you will usually make adjustments or override Bootstrap variables
