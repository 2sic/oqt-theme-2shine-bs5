# Oqtane Skin/Theme with Bootstrap5 

## Layouts

---

1. Default - Floating content on background, full-width sticky-header
2. Fullscreen - Modules can use the full width to set backgrounds
3. Centered - Content and Menu are max-width, background to right and left
4. Centered-Submenu - Paged/floating content with submenu to the left
5. Float-WideHeader - Paged/floating content with wide header

## WIP

---
1. Oqtane is still missing the DNN concept of each page having a specific language. 
That means the 2shine language classes and the page-root-neutral class are still missing. 
Those will be added as soon as Oqtane implments that feature.
